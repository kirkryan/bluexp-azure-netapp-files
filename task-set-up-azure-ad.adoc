BlueXP needs permissions to set up and manage Azure NetApp Files. You can grant the required permissions to an Azure account by creating and setting up an Azure Active Directory (AD) application and by obtaining the Azure credentials that BlueXP needs.

== Step 1: Create the AD application

Create an Azure AD application and service principal that BlueXP can use for role-based access control.

.Before you begin

You must have the right permissions in Azure to create an Active Directory application and to assign the application to a role. For details, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#required-permissions/[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Required permissions^].

.Steps

. From the Azure portal, open the *Azure Active Directory* service.
+

. In the menu, click *App registrations*.

. Create the application:

.. Click *New registration*.

.. Specify details about the application:

* *Name*: Enter a name for the application.
* *Account type*: Select an account type (any will work with BlueXP).
* *Redirect URI*: You can leave this blank.

.. Click *Register*.

. Copy the *Application (client) ID* and the *Directory (tenant) ID*.
+

+
When you create the Azure NetApp Files working environment in BlueXP, you need to provide the application (client) ID and the directory (tenant) ID for the application. BlueXP uses the IDs to programmatically sign in.

. Create a client secret for the application so BlueXP can use it to authenticate with Azure AD:

.. Click *Certificates & secrets > New client secret*.

.. Provide a description of the secret and a duration.

.. Click *Add*.

.. Copy the value of the client secret.
+

.Result

Your AD application is now setup and you should have copied the application (client) ID, the directory (tenant) ID, and the value of the client secret. You need to enter this information in BlueXP when you add an Azure NetApp Files working environment.

== Step 2: Assign the app to a role

You must bind the service principal to your Azure subscription and assign it a custom role that has the required permissions.

.Steps

. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles[Create a custom role in Azure^].
+
The following steps describe how to create the role from the Azure portal.

.. Open the subscription and click *Access control (IAM)*.

.. Click *Add > Add custom role*.
+
image:screenshot_azure_access_control.gif[A screenshot that shows the steps to add a custom role in the Azure portal.]

.. In the *Basics* tab, enter a name and description for the role.

.. Click *JSON* and click *Edit* which appears at the top right of the JSON format.

.. Add the following permissions under _actions_:
+
[source,json]
"actions": [
    "Microsoft.NetApp/*",
    "Microsoft.Resources/resources/read",
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/resources/read",
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write",
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read",
    "Microsoft.Insights/Metrics/Read"
    ],

.. Click *Save*, click *Next*, and then click *Create*.

. Now assign the application to the role that you just created:

.. From the Azure portal, open the *Subscriptions* service.

.. Select the subscription.

.. Click *Access control (IAM) > Add > Add role assignment*.

.. In the *Role* tab, select the custom role that you created and click *Next*.

.. In the *Members* tab, complete the following steps:

* Keep *User, group, or service principal* selected.
* Click *Select members*.
+

* Search for the name of the application.
+
Here's an example:
+
image:screenshot_anf_app_role.png[A screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Add role assignment form in the Azure portal.]

* Select the application and click *Select*.
* Click *Next*.

.. Click *Review + assign*.
+
The service principal for BlueXP now has the required Azure permissions for that subscription.

== Step 3: Add the credentials to BlueXP

When you create the Azure NetApp Files working environment, you're prompted to select the credentials associated with the service principal. You need to add these credentials to BlueXP before you create the working environment.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.
+

. Click *Add Credentials* and follow the steps in the wizard.

.. *Credentials Location*: Select *Microsoft Azure > BlueXP*.

.. *Define Credentials*: Enter information about the Azure Active Directory service principal that grants the required permissions:
+
* Client Secret
* Application (client) ID
* Directory (tenant) ID
+
You should have captured this information when you <<Create the AD application,created the AD application>>.

.. *Review*: Confirm the details about the new credentials and click *Add*.
